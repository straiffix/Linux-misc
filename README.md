Some funny stuff for Linux environment decorations

**Script which shows random poetry**
- hello.py - download random poetry from Poetry Foundation, using API, make a GTK window with invisible background, in the left corner of the screen. 
Looks like a vidget with poetry. Automatically crops poetry if number of lines increases some value. Color, font and placement can be changed. 
I am using with an autorun script, so poetry is loading each time whenever I run the system.
